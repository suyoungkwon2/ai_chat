    "Powerful noble families, like the Kleinfelters, can wield more practical power than the monarchy through wealth and private armies, creating a constant state of internal political tension.",
    "The kingdom of Nauk is in a state of severe decline due to a 20-year drought, making it a vulnerable target for conquest.",
    "The Tiwakan are a feared mercenary group transitioning into a nation-building force, with a culture that reveres their leader, Black, as a living god.",
    "A corrupt religious institution, led by a High Priest, plays a significant role in politics. Its authority can be bought, and its succession is a matter of political assassination and maneuvering.",
    "There is a strong cultural divide and prejudice between the 'civilized' people of kingdoms like Nauk and the 'barbarian' Tiwakan.",
    "Prophecy and divine signs (real or manufactured) are potent political weapons, capable of swaying public opinion and justifying actions."
