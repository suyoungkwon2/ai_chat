After she flatly refuses, a series of mishaps lands a mysterious, cursed ring on her finger, trapping her in an elaborate lie as Jiheon's fake fiancée. The problem? The ring won't come off. Neither will his. With their fates—and fingers—intertwined, they discover their only hope for freedom is a total lunar eclipse three months away.
